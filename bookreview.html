<h2>My thought</h2>
<p>Bod was upset that everyone in the graveyard refuse to talk about the Macabray (shares similar pronunciation with the word “macabre”). The word “macabre” is used to describe something that’s unpleasant, like death or violence. Then Silas taught Bod that sometimes people avoid to talk about something “they do not remember.” And in reality, people do tend to avoid speaking about certain things or ignore the existence of it as a way to get away with it. Like we don’t talk about the horrific murder or the deaths of family members. I thought it was interesting that the author turned the word “Macabre” into “Macabray” implying that the celebration was actually the horrible things happened in reality. Why do we only avoid talking about unpleasant things? What if we also avoid talking about something that are fun and pleasant? I think it is because we tend to avoid the feeling of fear and sadness. And talking about it like bringing back the fear and sadness.</p>
